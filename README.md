Metro North New Haven Line ASI WAV Files for Use with BMS Music System by NHC

https://www.nch.com.au/bms/index.html

I'm in no way linked commercially or otherwise with NCH software.

You can set the announcements to play with num pad triggering universally 1-9 at least. The first 1-9 in any playlist take precedence.


Use the free audio editor Audacity to open both the 0-StationListing WAV file and the 1-GCTH125th (No Station List) files and make your own 1-9 files for the first 9 station announcements. Then another 1-9 ready to bump up the playlist at the 9th stop as you take a minute or two to pause. Be sure to always press Escape or Pause (I prefer escape) before ALT-Tabbing out of a Train Simulator Window. I use TS2017 mostly but of course this completely detached or separate announcement system and software will work with anything or on its own. I apologize some of the pre-made announcements are off. Numbers 5 and 8 I think, so I'll be working on that when I can. Otherwise making your own is of course appreciated, too.



Not good at reading Metro North's schedules? Get real-time station information here. https://as0.mta.info/mnr/mstations/default.cfm

For any Station (select the station you are at or want to be located at in the Sim (starting station essentially) you can get a full stops list and track number.



Also here's Grand Central's Departure Board http://as0.mta.info/mnr/html/bigboard.cfm

Lastly, I am not in communication with Fan Railer from YouTube so I will not say this project has his blessing. In other words, I don't want the potentially poor quality of my own work to reflect his great reputation, not that it should. Take care.
